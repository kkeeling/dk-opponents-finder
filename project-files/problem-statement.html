    <h1>DraftKings Opponent Finder Chrome Extension: Problem Statement</h1>
    
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>DraftKings is a popular platform for daily fantasy sports contests. However, it can be challenging for users to quickly identify contests with less experienced opponents, which may offer better chances of winning.</p>
    
    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>Currently, users have to manually check each contest to determine the experience level of opponents. This process is time-consuming and inefficient, potentially causing users to miss out on favorable contests.</p>
    
    <h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
    <p>Develop a Chrome extension that overlays opponent experience data directly on the DraftKings lobby. This extension will:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Display the number of opponents with different experience levels (represented by badges) for contests with 5 or fewer entries.</li>
        <li>Provide visual cues to quickly identify contests with less experienced opponents.</li>
        <li>Integrate seamlessly with the DraftKings website, enhancing the user experience without disrupting the platform's functionality.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Benefits</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Save time for users by eliminating the need to manually check each contest.</li>
        <li>Improve decision-making by providing quick access to opponent experience information.</li>
        <li>Enhance user experience on the DraftKings platform.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Constraints</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Must comply with DraftKings' terms of service and API usage policies.</li>
        <li>Should not interfere with the normal functioning of the DraftKings website.</li>
        <li>Must handle authentication with DraftKings if required.</li>
    </ul>
